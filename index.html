    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>This work explores the intersection of brain-based frequency healing, spiritual perception, and subtle energetic influence. Through mental focus, intention, and energetic alignment, the author has facilitated real-world outcomes such as conflict resolution, job breakthroughs, and healing from spiritual interference (like black magic).</p>

    <p>This is not just a practice—it's a fine art. A rare gift, granted by Allah (SWT), the ultimate source of all healing and knowledge. Every result mentioned is by His will alone. The healer is merely the medium, not the cause.</p>

    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>Syed Waleed Mehboob Ali is a business owner in the marble and construction industry, a husband and father, and an energy-based healing practitioner. Without seeking social media attention, he works quietly and effectively in the background to help those in need using unique brain frequency techniques rooted in divine inspiration.</p>

  <section id="faq">
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Is this method based on science or spirituality?</strong><br>It’s a fusion of both—modern neuroscience and subtle spiritual awareness, practiced through intention and mental frequency control.</li>
      <li><strong>Do I need to meet you in person?</strong><br>No. Energy can be aligned and focused remotely through thought, prayer, and brainwave intention.</li>
      <li><strong>Is this hypnosis?</strong><br>Not at all. This is not suggestion-based. It is a unique, intentional process rooted in spiritual healing and mental influence.</li>
      <li><strong>Do you charge for your healing?</strong><br>This project is based on healing service, not business. Any exchange is voluntary and depends on the individual case.</li>
