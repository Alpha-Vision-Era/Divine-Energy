      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>This study explores the use of brain-based energy and spiritual frequency work to influence and heal individuals in the modern digital age. The author shares real-world healing case studies and personal experiences with a method that bridges spirituality and subtle influence.</p>
    </section><section>
  <h2>Healing Methodology</h2>
  <p>The healing method relies on intentional energy focus, brain frequency alignment, and a spiritually guided influence model. Unlike traditional hypnosis or reiki, this technique operates at a thought-frequency level, often without the subject's conscious awareness.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Family dispute resolved through subtle influence.</li>
    <li>Spiritual blockage cleared for job opportunity.</li>
    <li>Black magic/jaddu cases neutralized with brain-based healing.</li>
    <li>Investor decisions subtly influenced to support a client.</li>
    <li>Marriage-related blocks resolved by redirecting mental pathways.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Scientific Basis</h2>
  <p>The practice draws from neuroscience, frequency research, and ancient spiritual traditions. It suggests a unified field where thought, intention, and energy intersect in measurable but non-physical ways.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>True healing belongs to Allah. The practitioner simply channels the frequencies. This document is a reflection of a lived experience, not just theory.</p>
